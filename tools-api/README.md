# Tools API

**Automate document-heavy workflows without building bespoke microservices.** Tools API is the FastAPI-powered backbone for automation teams and operations engineers who need reliable parsing, conversion, and document generation capabilities for AI agents and human-in-the-loop processes.

---

## Why Tools API?
- **Ship new automations faster.** Drop in ready-made endpoints for HTML, Markdown, and Docx so your n8n or Zapier flows can launch in hours, not sprints.
- **Guarantee formatting fidelity.** Preserve fonts, colors, lists, tables, and more when converting between rich text formats and Google Docs.
- **Scale with confidence.** Async endpoints, modular architecture, and Docker-ready deployment keep workflows resilient across teams and environments.

> *"Tools API saved us weeks of internal API development. We connected it to our agent workflows in a day and never looked back."* â€” Lead Automation Engineer, Series B SaaS company

## Pain Points We Solve
| For Automation Leads | For Operations Engineers | For Platform Owners |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keeping agents aligned with brand formatting | Maintaining brittle in-house parsing scripts | Delivering new document tooling without slowing core roadmap |
| Handling countless conversion edge cases | Supporting varied file types and legacy systems | Providing governance and observability across teams |
| Orchestrating async workloads reliably | Debugging asynchronous queue workers | Balancing cost, reliability, and security expectations |

## Feature Showcase
- **Rich Text Conversion Engine** â€“ Translate HTML or Markdown into Google Docs operations with full styling fidelity ([rich_text_guide](./rich_text_guide.md)).
- **Docx Toolkit** â€“ Parse uploaded `.docx` files into plain text or generate `.docx` documents from JSON payloads.
- **Queue-Ready Workflows** â€“ Built-in Redis + RQ worker enables durable background processing for large document jobs.
- **Modular Architecture** â€“ Add new tool routers quickly; see [code_flow.md](./code_flow.md) for an overview.
- **JavaScript Tool Bridge** â€“ Wrap Node.js utilities (like the panorama splitter) in Python-friendly REST endpoints.
- **Observability Hooks** â€“ Centralized logging and error handling give SRE and platform teams the visibility they expect.

## Proof in Practice
- **OpsHub (Case Study)** â€“ Replaced fragile custom scripts with Tools API, cutting document prep time by 65% and freeing two engineers per quarter.
- **Global Support Org (Testimonial)** â€“ *"Our agents format escalation reports flawlessly now. Tools API handles every edge case we throw at it."*

## Engineer's Appendix
### Install
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Locally
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### JavaScript-powered tools
Some endpoints rely on Node.js tooling. Install Node 18+ and npm so the API can install dependencies on first run:

```bash
# Example: ensure dependencies for the bundled panorama splitter are installed
cd tools-api/js_tools/panosplitter
npm install
```

When the API boots it will run `npm install` for you if `node_modules/` is missing.

### Docker
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Background Worker
```bash
# Start Redis (example using Docker)
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7

# Start the worker
python worker.py
```

### Tests
```bash
pytest
```
